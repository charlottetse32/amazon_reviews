A web scrapper to scrap AMAZON reviews data. 
Requirment: Amazon reviews page 1 (url must have ...pagenumber = 1) 
link used in code = https://www.amazon.com/KOR-Free-Hydration-Vessel-Blue/product-reviews/B001K72L9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?%27+%5C+%27ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews%27&pageNumber=1
Disclamier: Amazon has anti-web scrapping measures, thus the code might have to be ran a few times for it to work
